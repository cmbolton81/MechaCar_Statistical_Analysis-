## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![summary](summary.png)
1. The vehicle length, and vehicle ground clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model.
2. 2. The p-Value for this model, p-Value: 5.35e-11, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indicates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.
3. This model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. We can tell this because the linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model
